# Original-Xbox-HDMI
An open-source hardware project to create an HDMI output for the original Xbox.

## Overview

This project aims to provide an open-source hardware design for an HDMI board for the original Xbox. The project includes a complete schematic, PCB design, and all necessary documentation to help enthusiasts and developers recreate or modify the board for their purposes.

## Features

- **HDMI Output:** Enables modern video output for the original Xbox, improving video quality and compatibility with contemporary displays.
- **Open Source:** All designs are provided under the GNU License, encouraging modifications and improvements by the community.
- **Customizable:** The design files are available for easy customization using Flux.ai, KiCAD, and other compatible tools.

## Tools Used

- **Flux.ai:** Used for designing the schematic and PCB layout, taking advantage of its extensive library and modification capabilities.
- **KiCAD:** Used for creating custom parts and verifying component integrity and functionality.
- **ChatGPT 4:** Assisted in refining the design and troubleshooting during the development process.
